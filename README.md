## Short Description
This blog web application, crafted utilizing React and Node and integrated with MongoDB, currently serves as a platform for personal posting, with aspirations to develop it into a community-oriented space in the future. While the application maintains full responsiveness, accessing it via a desktop view is recommended to experience the complete range of features.

## Motivation
From a front-end background, I recently delved into backend and database technologies. Motivated to test my expanded skill set, I embarked on this project, aiming to seamlessly integrate all three components. This endeavor marks my evolution towards becoming a proficient full-stack developer.

## ü§ù Contributions
This project is open to contributions! I am still working on some features (user dashboard, certified writer application section) and there's probably a ton of things to add/change/fix. Feel free to fork it and create a PR!
